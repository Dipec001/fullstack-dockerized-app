# 🧱 Full-Stack Dockerized App

This project is a simple full-stack application, progressing from running each service locally to containerizing them with Docker, followed by best-practice tweaks for production readiness.

It demonstrates how to build, containerize, and connect multiple services using Docker.

## 🧩 Stack Overview

- **Frontend**: React + Vite  
- **Backend APIs**:
  - Node.js (JavaScript)
  - Golang (Go)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
